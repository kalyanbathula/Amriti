          <li>
            Wash and dry the vegetables thoroughly. Cut them into thin slices or
            bite-sized pieces. Ensure they are uniform in size for even cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour,
            cornstarch, salt, and baking powder. Gradually pour in the ice-cold
            sparkling water while stirring gently. Mix until the batter is
            smooth, but do not overmix. It's okay if there are lumps.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a deep fryer or large pot, heat Amrti's Sunflower Oil to 350°F
            (180°C). Make sure there is enough oil to fully submerge the
            vegetables.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dip the sliced vegetables into the tempura batter, ensuring they are
            fully coated. Carefully place the battered vegetables into the hot
            oil, a few at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry in
            batches if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fry the vegetables for 2-3 minutes, or until they are golden brown
            and crispy. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove the fried
            vegetables from the oil and transfer them to a plate lined with
            paper towels to drain excess oil.
          </li>
          <li>Serve the crispy vegetable tempura immediately while hot.</li>
